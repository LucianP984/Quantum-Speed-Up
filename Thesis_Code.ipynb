It's possible for the simulation part to be faster than the classical optimizer's convergence for some specific problems/parameters, but this isn't a fundamental quantum speedup.\n","  - Potential for true quantum advantage arises ONLY if, on future fault-tolerant hardware, the quantum circuit execution part (O(shots * poly(nq))) becomes significantly faster than relevant classical computation steps, AND if the quantum perturbations consistently lead to faster convergence (fewer `quantum_iterations` needed) than a purely classical optimizer would achieve *after* the initial random search. This heuristic benefit is not guaranteed.\n","\n","Practical Limitations:\n","  - Classical simulation cost grows exponentially with the number of qubits (`num_qubits_max`={num_qubits_max}).\n","  - Current Quantum Hardware: Limited by noise, coherence time, qubit connectivity, and qubit count. The simple circuit used here is less demanding than Grover/QAOA but still subject to noise.\n","\"\"\"\n","    return complexity_analysis\n","\n","# --- Execution ---\n","print(\"Visualizing Implemented Quantum Circuit and Complexity Analysis...\\n\")\n","\n","# Visualize the circuit structure (e.g., for 6 qubits)\n","print(\"Sample Circuit Used for Hybrid Perturbation Generation:\")\n","print(visualize_hybrid_perturbation_circuit_ascii(num_qubits=6)) # Adjust num_qubits for a representative example\n","print(\"\\n\" + \"-\"*80 + \"\\n\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xBO305AvN0pJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748246763428,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"lucian pemaj","userId":"02610970617167187797"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"370c5b42-46c4-4a41-81ff-0832ad6f680b"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Visualizing Implemented Quantum Circuit and Complexity Analysis...\n","\n","Sample Circuit Used for Hybrid Perturbation Generation:\n","(Displaying circuit for 6 qubits)\n","     ┌───┐ ░                           ░ ┌─┐               \n","q_0: ┤ H ├─░───■───────────────────────░─┤M├───────────────\n","     ├───┤ ░ ┌─┴─┐                     ░ └╥┘┌─┐            \n","q_1: ┤ H ├─░─┤ X ├──■──────────────────░──╫─┤M├────────────\n","     ├───┤ ░ └───┘┌─┴─┐                ░  ║ └╥┘┌─┐         \n","q_2: ┤ H ├─░──────┤ X ├──■─────────────░──╫──╫─┤M├─────────\n","     ├───┤ ░      └───┘┌─┴─┐           ░  ║  ║ └╥┘┌─┐      \n","q_3: ┤ H ├─░───────────┤ X ├──■────────░──╫──╫──╫─┤M├──────\n","     ├───┤ ░           └───┘┌─┴─┐      ░  ║  ║  ║ └╥┘┌─┐   \n","q_4: ┤ H ├─░────────────────┤ X ├──■───░──╫──╫──╫──╫─┤M├───\n","     ├───┤ ░                └───┘┌─┴─┐ ░  ║  ║  ║  ║ └╥┘┌─┐\n","q_5: ┤ H ├─░─────────────────────┤ X ├─░──╫──╫──╫──╫──╫─┤M├\n","     └───┘ ░                     └───┘ ░  ║  ║  ║  ║  ║ └╥┘\n","c: 6/═════════════════════════════════════╩══╩══╩══╩══╩══╩═\n","                                          0  1  2  3  4  5 \n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Develop and compare trading strategies based on classical and quantum predictions\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import time # Make sure time is imported\n","\n","\n","# --- Signal Generation  ---\n","def generate_signals(price_data, predictions, threshold=0.0001):\n","    \"\"\"Generate trading signals based on price predictions\"\"\"\n","    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=price_data.index)\n","    # Ensure price_data index is datetime if possible for time calculations\n","    if not isinstance(price_data.index, pd.DatetimeIndex):\n","        try:\n","            price_data.index = pd.to_datetime(price_data.index)\n","            signals = pd.DataFrame(index=price_data.index) # Recreate with datetime index\n","        except:\n","            print(\"Warning: Could not convert price_data index to DatetimeIndex.\")\n","\n","\n","    for model, pred_series in predictions.items():\n","        if not isinstance(pred_series, pd.Series):\n","            if len(pred_series) == len(price_data.index):\n","                 pred = pd.Series(pred_series, index=price_data.index)\n","            else:\n","                 print(f\"Warning: Skipping signal generation for {model} due to length mismatch.\")\n","                 continue\n","        else:\n","             # Align index and fill missing values\n","             pred = pred_series.reindex(price_data.index).ffill().bfill()\n","\n","        pred_returns = pred.pct_change().fillna(0)\n","        signal_col = f'{model}_signal'\n","        signals[signal_col] = 0\n","        signals.loc[pred_returns > threshold, signal_col] = 1\n","        signals.loc[pred_returns < -threshold, signal_col] = -1\n","\n","    return signals\n","\n","# --- Modified Backtesting Function to Log Trades ---\n","def backtest_strategy_with_trade_log(price_data, signals, model_names):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Backtest trading strategy performance and log individual trades.\n","    Returns daily returns DataFrame and a dictionary of trade logs.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    returns = pd.DataFrame(index=price_data.index)\n","    trade_logs = {model: [] for model in model_names} # Initialize dict for logs\n","\n","    # Ensure price_data is a Series and has a numeric type\n","    if isinstance(price_data, pd.DataFrame):\n","         price_data = price_data.iloc[:, 0]\n","    price_data = pd.to_numeric(price_data, errors='coerce')\n","    price_returns = price_data.pct_change().fillna(0)\n","\n","    for model in model_names:\n","        signal_col = f'{model}_signal'\n","        if signal_col not in signals.columns:\n","             print(f\"Warning: Signal column {signal_col} not found.
